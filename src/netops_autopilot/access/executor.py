"""Real Config Executor — applies a RenderedConfig to a live device.

This is the highest-stakes module in the system. The execution contract:

* **T3 (no CONFIG without allowlist):** every line of the rendered config
  is structurally matched against :class:`CommandAllowlist` BEFORE it is
  sent. A line that does not match a CONFIG_REVERSIBLE/CONFIG_HIGH_RISK
  template — arity and every literal segment — is rejected; the executor
  never sends a command it cannot classify.
* **L04 (deterministic authority):** the executor takes a fully
  rendered config (the IR is gone) — no live LLM, no free-form text.
* **L09 (rollback on failure):** the executor pre-builds the rollback
  plan from the allowlist, **issues it to the device** on the first
  failure, re-reads state to confirm the device is back, and records
  whether the rollback actually completed. A rollback that did not
  complete is ``ROLLBACK_FAILED`` — loud, never silently reported as
  ``ROLLED_BACK``.
* **L13 (blast-radius is a recorded fact):** every change writes a
  `config_change` event to the ledger with the device_ref, the
  irreversible-flag, the before/after running-config hash, and the
  commit id (where available). A ledger write that fails is recorded on
  the ChangeRecord, never swallowed.
* **L11 (secrets redacted):** password fields are never sent in
  plaintext and never logged; the redact() pipeline runs on every
  command before it leaves the host.

The executor is **session-bound**: it does not own its own transport.
The caller passes a :class:`SerialConsoleTransport`, an
:class:`SSHConsoleTransport`, or any object with a matching ``execute``
method (the canonical ``ExecSession`` shape). This makes it equally
usable from the simulator and from real hardware.

Phase V changes (why they matter):

1. **The rollback plan is now actually issued.** The previous revision
   built ``rollback_commands`` and then discarded them: the loop body
   only recorded comment lines and never called ``session.execute``.
   The device was left half-configured while the record claimed
   ``ROLLED_BACK``. That is the single most dangerous defect this
   module ever had, because it made an unsafe state look safe.
2. **Rollback runs in the correct CLI mode.** Inverses are issued in
   reverse order with the mode stack rewound to the depth each command
   was applied at, so ``no name`` lands inside ``vlan 10`` and
   ``no vlan 10`` lands in global config.
3. **Mode-transition wrappers are sent.** ``configure terminal`` used to
   be swallowed as a comment, so config lines reached a real device in
   user EXEC mode and failed. Wrappers are now issued, gated by a closed
   set of known mode-transition commands.
4. **Allowlist matching is structural.** First-token matching let
   ``ip http server`` through because ``ip routing`` was registered.
