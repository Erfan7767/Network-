"""Design Engine — blueprint × discovered topology × IPAM ⇒ per-device IR.

Converts a COMPILED Network Intent + Blueprint + Crawl Report into a fully
deterministic site design and one ConfigIR per device:

* roles are EVIDENCE-selected: the router is the device directly attached
  to the WAN zone per the human's answer; L2/L3 capability comes from the
  Capability Matrix (E06) — UNKNOWN capability means the device is L2-only
  (never assumed, T2), and no IR node is planned requiring the unknown
  capability;
* VLAN ids are a fixed ascending assignment from a VLAN pool; zone→subnet
  uses IPAM ``subnet_for_hosts`` + ``allocate_subnet`` on a stable index —
  identical inputs produce the identical plan;
* uplinks come from discovered links (best FSM-4 grade, deterministic
  tie-break); access ports are the device's remaining local ports from
  interface harvest — a device with no unused harvested port simply gets
  no access assignment (visible in the plan), never an invented port;
* every plan entry and IR node carries the evidence/decision lineage that
  produced it (``reason`` codes), so the plan is auditable end-to-end.
