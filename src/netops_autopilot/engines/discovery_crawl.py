"""Discovery Crawl Engine — evidence-driven multi-device discovery (§10).

The operator's scenario, mechanized: ONE device is connected to the PC; the
engine identifies it with real show commands, reads its neighbor evidence
(LLDP/CDP/MNDP — passive only), then walks to every reachable neighbor and
repeats until the frontier is exhausted. Nothing is assumed:

* the command plan is DERIVED from the parser catalog ∩ the vendor's
  READ_ONLY allowlist — a command with no parser (or a parser with no
  allowlisted command) is simply not issued, and the omission is reported;
* every neighbor edge feeds FSM-4 (Link Evidence Engine): one-sided tables
  reach ONE_SIDED at most, bidirectional matches reach the passive ceiling
  DIRECT_NEIGHBOR_PROBABLE; CONFIRMED/PHYSICAL stay for later gated proof;
* a device whose session factory refuses is recorded UNREACHABLE with the
  failure cause — never silently dropped (T4 per-device n/N accounting);
* the crawl is DETERMINISTIC: sorted frontier, stable plan order, stable
  report ordering; replaying it over identical sessions is byte-identical.
