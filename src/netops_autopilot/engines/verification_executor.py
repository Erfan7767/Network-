"""Phase 7 — execute the derived verification matrix against real device state.

``VerificationPlanner`` derives the mandatory tests and ``VerificationEngine``
grades the results, but nothing ever ran the tests. ``TestResult.evidence_id``
was documented as "produced downstream" and there was no downstream: the
pipeline ended at ``EXECUTION_GATE`` → ``REPORT``, so a run could report
``COMPLETE-APPLIED`` having never once asked the network whether it works.
"Config stuck" is not "requirement met".

This module is that missing downstream. Every test is graded ONLY from what a
device actually answered, collected through :class:`Collector` — which enforces
the READ_ONLY allowlist and records an Event + Artifact in the ledger. The
``evidence_id`` on each :class:`TestResult` is that artifact's ``raw_id``, so
every PASS is traceable to a real response (T1).

A test whose evidence cannot be obtained produces **no result at all**. That is
deliberate: :meth:`VerificationEngine.evaluate` then raises
``TEST_RESULTS_MISSING`` instead of letting an unrun test read as PASS. The
unrun tests and their reasons are returned on the outcome so the operator sees
exactly what was not proven and why (L01).

Grading rules are deliberately narrow. A test PASSes only when every
precondition it depends on is *positively observed* in device output. A
precondition that is positively contradicted is a FAIL. An absent pattern is a
FAIL, not a PASS — the platform never treats "I did not see a problem" as
evidence of health.
