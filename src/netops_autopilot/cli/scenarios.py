"""Built-in demo scenarios for the operator CLI.

Each scenario is a fully-scripted ``ConsoleIO`` answer set so the demo
runs deterministically, no hardware required. Scenarios exercise different
network shapes (branch office, leaf-spine, hotel guest WiFi, retail POS)
to validate the elicitation → intent compiler → design pipeline.
